          from the unusual variety of rice called Jeerakasala. Unlike the other
          kind of popular biryanis where basmati rice is used Thalassery biryan
          is made using a premium quality short grain rice which is also known
          as kaima rice or biriyani rice in Kerala.. The biriyani masala and
          cooked rice are arranged in layers inside the dish. Meat is cooked
          with the masala on a low heat and layered with rice before the lid of
          the container is sealed with dough. Hot coal or charcoal is then
          placed above the lid.

          vegetables. The crucial ingredient is fresh coconut milk, which lends
          a sweet flavor.
